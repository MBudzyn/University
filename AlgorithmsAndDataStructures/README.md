# 📚 Exam Preparation - Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains materials, notes, and reference documents I prepared for the **exam in Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures** (AISD) at the **University of Wrocław**.  
It is primarily **theoretical**, as exercises in this course were mostly paper-based, focusing on understanding algorithmic principles and problem-solving strategies.

## 🧭 Overview

The repository is organized by topic, with PDF lectures, notes, and reference materials for self-study.  
It was created to **aid in exam preparation** and to consolidate important concepts and algorithms in one place.
