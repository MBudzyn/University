# PracticalAlgorithmics2

## Introduction
This folder was created during the **Practical Algorithmics 2** course and contains exercises, specifications, and example code developed during lectures and practical sessions. The repository documents solutions to algorithmic tasks and provides reference implementations for a variety of problems.

## Topics Covered

  - Sieve of Eratosthenes  

- **Chinese Remainder Theorem** and **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**  
  - Union-Find data structure with path compression  
  - Merging smaller sets into larger ones  
  - Applications in problem-solving  

- **Block decomposition and Mo’s algorithm**  
  - Square root decomposition for query optimization  
  - Shortest Hamiltonian path in plane  
  - Query splitting techniques
