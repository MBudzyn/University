# 🧠 Practical Algorithmics 2

This repository contains exercises, specifications, and example code from the **Practical Algorithmics 2** course at the **University of Wrocław**.  
It serves as a documentation of **algorithmic solutions** and **reference implementations** explored during lectures and practical sessions.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The course focuses on understanding **advanced algorithmic techniques** and applying them to solve a wide range of problems efficiently.  
The repository is divided into:

- **`list1/ ... list12/`** — Lecture exercises with specifications and solutions in C++  
- **`main.cpp`** — Optional combined entry point for testing multiple exercises

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- **Number Theory & Modular Arithmetic** — Extended Euclidean Algorithm, modular inverses, Euler's totient function, divisor counting  
- **Disjoint Set Union & CRT** — Union-Find, path compression, merging sets, Chinese Remainder Theorem  
- **Block Decomposition & Mo’s Algorithm** — Square root decomposition, query splitting, shortest Hamiltonian paths  
- **Range Queries** — RMQ using sparse table, divide and conquer, monotonic stacks  
- **Dynamic Programming on Trees & Bitmasking** — Tree diameter, maximum matching, assignment problem optimizations  
- **Segment Trees** — Range updates, sums, maxima, lazy propagation  
- **Graph Algorithms** — Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall), negative cycles, topological sorting, longest path  
- **Geometric Algorithms** — Point location, polygon area, distances, convex hulls, visibility
