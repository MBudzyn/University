# 🎓 University of Wrocław – Computer Science Repository

Welcome to my academic repository!  
This collection includes coursework, projects, and exercises completed during my **Computer Science studies at the University of Wrocław (UWR)**.  
Each folder corresponds to a specific subject, containing assignments, lab work, or larger projects developed throughout multiple semesters.

## 🧩 Worth Mentioning

Although not all courses resulted in dedicated repositories, the following subjects were an integral part of my Computer Science degree and helped build a strong theoretical foundation.

- **Mathematical Analysis** *(Semester 1)* - continuous mathematics, limits, derivatives, integrals; all work handwritten and theoretical.  
- **Logic for Computer Science** *(Semester 1)* - formal logic and reasoning; theoretical exercises.  
- **Introduction to Computer Science** *(Semester 1)* - foundations of algorithms and basic programming concepts.  
- **Basic IT Workshop** *(Semester 1)* - Git, practical computing skills; work completed in labs.   
- **Algebra** *(Semester 2)* - group, ring, and field theory; theoretical exercises.  
- **Databases** *(Semester 3)* - SQL, normalization, and relational database theory; practical lab tasks without permanent projects.
- **LLM Seminar** *(Semester 3)* - language modeling concepts; seminar participation and reports.
- **Discrete Mathematics** *(Semester 3)* - logic, combinatorics, and graph theory; theoretical exercises completed on paper. 
- **Probability Theory and Statistics** *(Semester 4)* - probabilistic models and statistical inference; written analytical exercises.  
- **Computer Systems** *(Semester 6)* - processor architecture, memory management, and low-level computing; theoretical problem solving.  
- **Computer Networks** *(Semester 6)* - OSI/TCP-IP models, routing, and virtual machine configuration; live lab demonstrations without code submissions.

## 🧰 Development Notes

Each subject folder may contain:
- 📘 `README.md` files – topic summaries and task overviews  
- 🧾 `listaX` directories – individual assignment lists  
- 🧪 `lab_sessions`, `tasks`, or `projects` – categorized coursework or experiments

## 💡 Future Plans

This repository is continuously evolving as I progress through my degree.  
Upcoming improvements:
- 🧹 Standardizing project structures and naming conventions  
- 🧾 Adding concise summaries for each subject folder  
- 🆕 Filling in missing courses and adding new subjects as I complete them
